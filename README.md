# Obfuscator

This is my attempt to create an obfuscator for Python code.

## Purpose

Personally, I have no need to obfuscate my code, since I don't have any super secret scripts that I need to make harder to read.

However, I find code obfuscation interesting, and that's a good enough reason to start a project.
